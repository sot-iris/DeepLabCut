# annotator in *.csv file

# Set this true if the data was sequentially labeled and if there is one file per folder (you can set the name of this file below, i.e. multibodypartsfilename)
# Otherwise there should be individual files per bodypart, i.e. in our demo case hand.csv, Finger1.csv etc.
# If true then those files will be generated from Results.txt

# When importing the images and the labels in the csv/xls files should be in the same order!
# During labeling in Fiji one can thus (for occluded body parts) click in the origin of the image 
#(i.e. top left corner (close to 0,0)), these "false" labels will then be removed. To do so set the following variable:
#set this to 0 if no labels should be removed!

invisibleboundary=100 # If labels are closer to origin than this number they are set to NaN (not a number). Please adjust to your situation. Units in pixel.
